## Why nopAccelerate PLUS Pro?

**Better Search = More Revenue!!**

nopAccelerate Plus Pro is completely different compared to nopAccelerate. We started nopAccelerate in 2013-14 and since we see a lot of change in nopCommerce architecture which allows to design and develop the new integration plugin in the more proficient and modern way, something which can be integrated effortlessly in a more standard way. This time our product will be more compatible with other themes & plugins and is easier to extend and maintain.

nopAccelerate Plus Pro includes Search & Facets features as well that makes it different from nopAccelerate Plus Search.
